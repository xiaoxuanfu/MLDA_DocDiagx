# HIV Treatment Recommendation with Reinforcement Learning (RL)

## Overview

This project aims to bridge the gap in healthcare delivery, especially in developing countries, by implementing Precision Medicine principles through Dynamic Treatment Regimens (DTR) optimized with Reinforcement Learning (RL). Our goal is to tailor treatment to individual patients, taking into account their unique genetic makeup, lifestyle, and environmental factors, thereby improving treatment outcomes where resources are most limited.

## Problem Statement

Global healthcare faces a significant challenge: the one-size-fits-all approach to medicine often fails to address the diverse needs of individual patients. This issue is particularly pronounced in developing countries, where limited healthcare resources and high disease burdens exacerbate the need for precise, personalized treatment plans.

## Why Precision Medicine?

Precision Medicine represents a paradigm shift towards personalized care, promising to enhance patient outcomes by considering individual differences. In resource-constrained settings, it offers a pathway to equitable healthcare, ensuring that each patient receives the most effective treatment based on their unique profile.

## Dynamic Treatment Regimens (DTR)

DTRs are at the core of our approach, providing a framework for adapting treatment plans over time. They allow for the sequential adjustment of treatments in response to the patient's evolving condition, maximizing the efficacy of available healthcare resources.

## Role of Reinforcement Learning (RL)

Reinforcement Learning enables us to navigate the complexity of personalized treatment. By learning from each decision and its outcome, RL algorithms can identify optimal treatment pathways for individual patients, making DTRs both dynamic and data-driven.
